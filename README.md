## About
This is the official public repository for the vs. Hecker mod. This is an **unfinished** version of the next update of [Unity Party](https://gamejolt.com/games/unityparty/632556). It is **not** recommended to use this Unity project for your own project. It is best to wait until the next Unity Party update is released then use that instead.

## Q&A
### Why is there so many clutter? (unused files, bad file system, etc.)
Because I am not a professional game developer. I never intended to take a Unity FNF' engine this far so I never accounted for cleaniness and neatness.
### Are you accepting pull requests?
For this repository, no. It's a one-time kind of thing.
### Why is the code so bad? (long blocks, lots of code in `Update()`, unused scripts, etc.)
Read the answer to the first question.
### Why publicize the repository of an unfinished version of the engine?
It was requested to by Lad.
### What is the license?
We do not believe this engine falls under the definition of a "modification of Friday Night Funkin'", so we use a different license.

In layman's terms, you are free to share, distribute, and show off this mod. You may also freely modify it however you wish, but you **are required to** use the same license and **without** commercial use.
